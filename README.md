    - Flask-Login is employed for user session management.

### What I've Learned

Creating the Heliades Farming Solutions Blog has been a valuable learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Flask Web Development:** Developing a web application from scratch using Flask, a micro web framework for Python, has allowed me to understand the fundamental concepts of web development.

2. **Database Management:** Learning to work with databases, specifically PostgreSQL, has been crucial for storing and managing user data, blog posts, and comments efficiently.

3. **User Authentication:** Implementing user registration and authentication systems using Flask-Login and password hashing has enhanced my understanding of user security.

4. **Form Handling:** Working with Flask-WTF for form handling and validation has enabled me to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

5. **Security Best Practices:** I've gained insights into security best practices, such as CSRF protection and password hashing, to safeguard the application and user data.

6. **Front-End Integration:** Integrating a rich text editor (CKEditor) for content creation and ensuring a responsive design has improved my front-end development skills.

7. **Admin Functionality:** Implementing admin-only functionality has deepened my understanding of access control and permissions.

8. **Deployment:** Deploying the application on a hosting platform (e.g., Render.com) has taught me about the deployment process, environment variables, and server configuration.

Overall, this project has allowed me to apply and reinforce my knowledge of web development and has prepared me for more complex web application projects in the future.
