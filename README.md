# Completed Python Web Project

A basic blog I created using flask for the company I work for, called Heliades Farming Solutions. It is a farm consulting company that specializes in small ruminants 

## Description

I used Flask and Sqlalchemy to create a functional responsive website where users can create accounts and make comments on the existing posts. Bootstrap was used to make the site responsive. Any feedback would be grately appreciated.
